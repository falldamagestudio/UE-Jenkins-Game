# UE-Jenkins-Game

This repo contains an example game, plus some build scripts. The build scripts are intended to be driven by [https://github.com/falldamagestudio.com/UE-Jenkins-BuildSystem](UE-Jenkins-BuildSystem).

`desired_engine_version_*.json` should refer to engine versions that have been built by running jobs from [https://github.com/falldamagestudio/UE-Jenkins-Engine](UE-Jenkins-Engine). Once an engine version is present, the build scripts in this repo can build a game, and you can use UE & edit the game locally.
